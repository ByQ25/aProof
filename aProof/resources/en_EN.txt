prop.settings.help.messagebox.text=I simulate a discussion between a number of agents based on facts created using a dictionary defined in a file: "dictionary.csv". The file contains four rows: variables row, nouns row, relations row, multiplicity of relations row. The simulation settings might be changed by editing the configuration file: "aProof.exe.config". Resulting debate may be easily saved to a text file by pressing the following key combination: "ctrl + s".

prop.input.textbox.message=In order to create a packet made of assumptions and goals which will be assigned to one of the agents before the simulation one should put them in this field and then save the input by clicking the button.:newli:Those assumptions and goals have to be compliant with given dictionary and written in a format which is compatible with the "Prover9" app. It is possible to give an arbitrary number of packets, but those have to be defined and saved one by one.:newli:A singular row represents a single assumption or a single goal. Assumptions have to be inserted before goals and it is important to separate one group from another by at least one empty row. Example below::newli::newli:Raining -> Wet.:newli:Raining.:newli::newli:Wet.
